# Perpetual-Arbitrage-Tradergotchi (PATs)
Are basically like Tamagotchis except its a little pet degen trader.  

When you buy a token you decide on tiers of starting capital for your tradergotchi to start with, theres tiers have different artwork assiciated.

Your tradergotchi is a dynamic nft, it will always be displaying an animated scene of you tradergotchi in its cube room.

The animated scenes will show the actions of your programatic trading strategy by having your tradergotchi act them out. 

The starting capital is put into a programatic trading strategy

You can access a dashboard on pats.cool/tradergotchi/login where you can see historical performance data, logs of actions, and adujust the tradign strategy.

Everytime your tradergotchi successfully executes a buy or sell you will earn 1 "STONK" token 

"STONK" tokens are used to buy aesthetic upgrades for your tradergotchi and its cube in the dashboard 

You can also stake "STONK" for the swap pool
